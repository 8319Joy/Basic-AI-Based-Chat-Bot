    "Creating an AI-based software application using Python can be achieved via various libraries and frameworks. A real-time example can be a simple chatbot using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. Below, I'll guide you through building a basic chatbot using Python with the help of the nltk (Natural Language Toolkit) and flask for web deployment. We'll build a console-based chatbot for demonstration purposes, and I'll provide sample outputs."
